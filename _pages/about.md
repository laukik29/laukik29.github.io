<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I am a final year undergraduate student at [BITS, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) pursuing dual degree in Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering
 Master of Science in Biological Sciences. I am currently working with [Prof. Guillaume A SARTORETTI](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/sartoretti-guillaume-a/) at the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Lab](https://www.marmotlab.org/index.html) on curriculum learning for sample efficient anf robust legged locomotion policies. My research interests lie in bridging the sim to real gap for deployment of locomotion policies for legged robots, bio-inspired imitation learning and robot manipulation. I want to improve the reinforcement learning control policy training for legged robots in terms of robustness to unseen environments. 

 Previously I have worked with [Prof. Kunal Korgaonkar](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/kunal-kishore-korgaonkar/) on human pose detection and correction at the  CSIS Robotics Lab.
 I have also worked with [Prof. Meenal Kowshik](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/meenal-kowshik/) on predicting Autoimmune diseases and exploring their genetic correlation using machine learning. 

 I have also interned at [Pyrotech Electronics Pvt. Ltd.](https://pyrotechindia.com/) during summer in my sophomore year where i worked on the development of an E-Medical Kiosk for improving health dispensing to masses especially after the COVID19 pandemic. 

My passion is applying theoretical advancements in the field of Learning to meaningful and impactful tasks. I find robotics as a direct way to do so and the visualization of the work sparks even more motivation and amazement for me. When I am not indulged in research, I love to play football, practice martial arts, and enjoy watching all sport games.
